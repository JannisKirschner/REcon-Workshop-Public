01 - Asteroids

Hello Cadet,

Welcome to the international space fleet.
We received an ominous distress signal from quadrant #4. 
For your first assignment you need to go and investigate it ASAP!
However your way is long and paved with asteroids.
Can you calculate a safe path through the asteroid fields? 
Hurry please...time is running out!
