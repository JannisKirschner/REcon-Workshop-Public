02 - Hyperspace

Congratulations, you successfully maneuvered your way around the asteroid fields!
Your target, however, is over 200 lightyears away.
Our intel has revealed that the distress signal is being transmitted by an experimental research outpost.
Can you successfully activate the hyperdrive, bypass the distance and rescue the scientists?
