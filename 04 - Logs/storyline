04 - Logs

The most concerning part of the now opened room were not the bodies stacked on the floor.
Neither was it the distinct stench that poured out like a menacing cloud hovering over the ground. 
It was the silence. 
What happened here? 
You scan the room and discover an old dashboard full of blinking lights.
After investigating it, you notice that it should provide logs of the previous events.
This should illuminate the strange circumstances that brought you here!
To access them you need to scan the correct keycard...can you find it?
