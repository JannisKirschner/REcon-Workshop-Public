03 - Levers

The massive brutalist structure of the experimental research facility appears in front of your cockpit as you exit the hyperdrive. 
A dark, eerie atmosphere eminates from this strange laboratory...like something had gone terribly terribly wrong.
This was no time for hesitation and so you enter the long corridor.
After what felt like hours running through a seemingly hyperbolic hallway you reach an array of knobs and levers that control a massive door, leading to the laboratory.
Can you discover the hidden combination and reveal the secrets that lie behind it?
